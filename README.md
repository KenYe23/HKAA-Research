•	Spearheaded a statistical analysis project that examines the impact of obesity on the ability to measure the Hip-Knee-Ankle Angle (HKAA), a key surgical indicator in arthroplasty patients.

•	Annotated 200+ DICOM images using ImageJ; Calculated HKAA and classified deformity type for each leg; Leveraged data-driven methodologies to assess measurement accuracy with inter-rater variability computation and compare patient demographics across obesity classes with statistical tests such as ANOVA and Chi-Square.

•	Assisted in a deep learning project aimed at automating the measurement of HKAA and validated its effectiveness by calculating summary statistics and inter-rater variability between human raters and the computer vision model.
